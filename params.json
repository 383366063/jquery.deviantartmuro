You can also make scripted use of a number of [deviantART muro][damuro] tools such as filters.\r\n\r\nYour users aren't required to have a [deviantART][da] or [Sta.sh][stash] account, but if they have one or they sign-up within the application, there's a number of added benefits such as [Sta.sh][stash] integration and [deviantART muro][damuro] redraw that happen automatically.\r\n\r\nThe documentation is maintained within the GitHib wiki:\r\n\r\n * http://github.com/deviantART/jquery.deviantartmuro/wiki/Home\r\n * http://github.com/deviantART/jquery.deviantartmuro/wiki/Reference\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in the underlying [deviantART muro][damuro] API, it has its own wiki too:\r\n\r\n * http://github.com/deviantART/embedded-deviantART-muro/wiki/Home\r\n\r\nRelease status\r\n==============\r\n\r\nThis code is currently considered pre-alpha and a work-in-progress intended for third-party developer early access and feedback. The underlying [deviantART muro][damuro] API and example code are currently in a state of flux and subject to breakage without notice, although the jQuery plugin endeavours to provide a stable programatic interface to that underlying API.\r\n\r\nWe will update this status message and tag a release as and when this status changes.\r\n\r\nLicenses\r\n========\r\n\r\nPlease check the LICENSES.txt file for full details on the licensing, the quick synopsis is that image assets are provided under a Creative Commons Attribution License and the code snippets are under a BSD 3-Clause License.\r\n\r\n[damuro]: http://sta.sh/muro\r\n[da]: http://www.deviantart.com/\r\n[stash]: http://sta.sh/\r\n","name":"jquery.deviantartmuro","tagline":"jQuery plugin for embedding the HTML5 drawing app, deviantART muro, on your site."}
