jquery.deviantartmuro
=====================

jquery.deviantartmuro is a jQuery plugin to provide a convenient wrapper around the embedding API for the [deviantART muro][damuro] HTML5 drawing application, allowing you to provide image drawing and editing within third-party sites.

Embedding [deviantART muro][damuro] in your site allows you to pass images from your site to [deviantART muro][damuro], allow your users to edit those images, and then hand the saved image data back to your site. You can also make scripted use of a number of [deviantART muro][damuro] tools such as filters.

Your users aren't required to have a [deviantART][da] or [Sta.sh][stash] account, but if they have one or they sign-up within the application, there's a number of added benefits such as [Sta.sh][stash] integration and [deviantART muro][damuro] redraw that happen automatically.

The documentation is maintained within the GitHib wiki:
